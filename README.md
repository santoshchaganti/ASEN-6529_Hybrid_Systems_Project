## Project Description:

<div> This project explores the application of A* and Q-learning algorithms for pathfinding in a 4x4 grid world environment constrained by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications. Phase 1 utilizes the A* algorithm to determine optimal paths that comply with LTL rules, demonstrating high efficiency and reliability in static and predictable scenarios. Phase 2 investigates the adaptability of Q-learning in the same environment, where it shows potential but requires further tuning to achieve consistent performance. Comparative analysis reveals A* as more suitable for environments requiring deterministic outcomes and minimal computational resources, whereas Q-learning offers advantages in dynamic settings where adaptability is key. This study underscores the need for advanced learning strategies in Q-learning to enhance its application in real-time autonomous navigation systems.
